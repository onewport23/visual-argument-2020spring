In this preview I am displaying the beginning stages of my visual argument, "It Takes Two." As I mentioned in my project proposal, I'd like to create an image that urges the viewer to uphold  correct recycling practices. For this specific argument, my goal is to inform people that all plastic cups must be clean and dry in order to be recycled (thus, it takes two). This is a play off of the 80's hit "It Takes Two" by Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock. I hope to use their imagery, tone, and aesthetic as a part of my argument to further strengthen its effectiveness. 

In terms of this preview, I have begun to insert text and one image. I am in the process of selecting a typeface and text color, in addition to determining the graphic's layout. As seen in the image that I have pushed to the repository, I have separated the line "it takes two to make a think go right" into "it takes two" and "to make a thing go right." I am attempting to utilize the "dominance" facet of design by scaling "two" larger then the rest of the line. This is to emphasize the "two step" message that I am trying to deliver in the image. 

Next steps: 
- source plastic cup images (one dirty, one clean, and one dry (determine whether these can be found online, or if they need to be personally illustrated)
- play with the typefaces; Is the current font that I am using consistent with the "It Take Two" style and "brand?" Will the viewer be able to understand the connection between the text and the 80's music reference? 
- explore 80's rap aestethic and see if there are any key elements that I could integrate into my own design
- review the elements of design and determine whether or not I am effectively and strategically implementing them
