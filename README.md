"It Takes Two" is a graphic used to inform viewers of the necessary steps to take before recycling a used, plastic cup. The messaging plays off of the 1980's hit "It Takes Two" by Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock, in which they rap the chorus: "it takes two to make a thing go right." Using that line, the image demonstrates that it takes two steps (cleaning and drying) a cup, before it goes right (is properly recycled).
